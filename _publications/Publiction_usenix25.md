**Abstract**  
Apple’s Find My network, leveraging over a billion active
Apple devices, is the world’s largest device-locating network.
We investigate the potential misuse of this network to maliciously track Bluetooth devices. We present nRootTag, a
novel attack method that transforms computers into trackable “AirTags” without requiring root privileges. The attack
achieves a success rate of over 90% within minutes at a cost
of only a few US dollars. Or, a rainbow table can be built
to search keys instantly. Subsequently, it can locate a computer in minutes, posing a substantial risk to user privacy and
safety. The attack is effective on Linux, Windows, and Android systems, and can be employed to track desktops, laptops,
smartphones, and IoT devices. Our comprehensive evaluation
demonstrates nRootTag’s effectiveness and efficiency across
various scenarios.
