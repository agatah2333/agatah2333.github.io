I am a 4th-year Ph.D. Student at the Department of Computer Science, [George Mason University (GMU)](https://www.gmu.edu/). Prior to joining George Mason, I earned the Bachelor degree in Computer Science in 2017 from Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, and obtained the Master degree from the University of Melbourne, Australia, in 2020.

My research mainly focuses on IoT Attacks and Defenses.

I also maintain a deadline countdown website for conferences related to software analysis, security & privacy, and AI: [Cybersecurity-Lab-GMU DDL Countdowns](https://cybersecurity-lab-gmu.github.io/).  
Contributions through pull requests or merge requests are welcome!!
 <!-- My reserch interests include IoT vulnerability analysis, mobile computing and software engineering. -->

* Tracking You from a Thousand Miles Away! Turning a Bluetooth Device into an Apple AirTag Without Root Privileges 

  Junming Chen, **Xiaoyue Ma**, Lannan Luo, Qiang Zeng.

  *Security'25*, Seattle, USA, Aug. 2025

This work discovered a fascinating bug in Apple's system. Exploiting this bug, an attacker could turn a non-Apple device into an AirTag, making all iPhones worldwide act as free "spies" to report the location of the device. Apple has urgently patched this bug!
