I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science, [George Mason University (GMU)](https://www.gmu.edu/). Prior to joining George Mason, I earned the Bachelor degree in Computer Science in 2017 from Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, and obtained the Master degree from the University of Melbourne, Australia, in 2020.

My research mainly focuses on IoT Attacks and Defenses.

I also maintain a deadline countdown website for conferences related to software analysis, security & privacy, and AI: [Cybersecurity-Lab-GMU DDL Countdowns](https://cybersecurity-lab-gmu.github.io/).  
Contributions through pull requests or merge requests are welcome!!
 <!-- My reserch interests include IoT vulnerability analysis, mobile computing and software engineering. -->
